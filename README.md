# Smile Programming Language Interpreter

**Copyright &copy; 2004-2015 Sean Werkema**

<hr />

**This is the C implementation of the Smile Programming Language.**

Smile is a functional, object-oriented, dynamically-typed programming
language with a flexible syntax.  It is heavily inspired by Lisp and
Smalltalk and JavaScript, and is as mutatable and extensible as a true
Lisp, but it reads more like Python or Ruby.

More information on Smile can be found at http://www.smile-lang.org.  An
informal development blog can also be found at http://www.werkema.com.

(*Note: This implementation is currently **very** incomplete but growing,
and it will eventually become the official implementation.  It is **not**
usable in its current form (yet).  If you want the much-more-complete and
fairly-usable (but slow) C# implementation, you'll need to look elsewhere,
as it's not hosted here.*)
