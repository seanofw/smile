**This is the C implementation of the Smile Programming Language.**

Smile is a functional, object-oriented, dynamically-typed programming
language with a flexible syntax.  It is heavily inspired by Lisp and
Smalltalk and JavaScript, and is as mutatable and extensible as a true
Lisp, but it reads more like Python or Ruby.

(_Note: This C implementation is somewhat incomplete but growing,
and it will soon become the official implementation.  It is **somewhat**
usable in its current form, and will likely pass the old C# implementation by
the end of 2018._)

## Third-Party Software

Smile uses third-party software libraries for some functionality:

- The Boehm mostly-conservative garbage collector.  http://www.hboehm.info/gc/
- The Intel Decimal Floating-Point Math Library.  https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-decimal-floating-point-math-library

These software libraries are covered under their own licenses, but all use forms of
non-restrictive open-source licenses (in the cases above, the MIT and BSD licenses,
respectively).

Smile does not contain commercially-licensed third-party software.
Smile does not contain GPL- or LGPL-licensed third-party software.
