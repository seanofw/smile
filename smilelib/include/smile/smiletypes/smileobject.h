/// <h3>Documentation for the standard fourteen Smile object methods</h3>
///
/// <hr />
/// <h4>Base operations:</h4>
///
/// <code>compareEqual</code>:	<p>Compare this object against another object, which could be an object of any type.
///	Return true if they are logically equal, false if they are not.  This must follow the
///	rules listed below:</p>
///	<ul>
///	<li>Objects may only be equal if they are of the same SMILE_KIND;</li>
///	<li>Equality is commutative; that is, "a == b" has the same meaning as "b == a".</li>
///	<li>The equality function must be defined consistent with the hash() function below.</li>
///	<li>The equality function should run in constant time.</li>
///	<li>The only object that may equal the Primitive instance is the Primitive instance.</li>
///	<li>The only object that may equal the Null instance is the Null instance.</li>
///	</ul>
///	
/// <code>hash</code>:	<p>Generate a 32-bit hash code for this object that would allow it to be suitable for
///	use as a dictionary key.  The following rules for hash codes must be observed:</p>
///	<ul>
///	<li>Hashing must be consistent; that is, hash(x) must equal hash(x) no matter how
///			many times it is invoked nor where or when it is invoked for the same x.</li>
///	<li>Hashing must be consistent with object equality; that is, if a ==b, then
///			hash(a) == hash(b).</li>
///	<li>Hash codes should be as close to uniformly-randomly-distributed as possible.</li>
///	</ul>
///	
/// <code>deepEqual</code>:	<p>Compare this object against another object, which could be an object of any type.
///	Return true if they are logically equal, false if they are not.  This must follow the
///	rules listed below:</p>
///	<ul>
///	<li>Objects may only be equal if they are of the same SMILE_KIND;</li>
///	<li>Equality is commutative; that is, "a == b" has the same meaning as "b == a".</li>
///	<li>The equality function must be defined consistent with the hash() function below.</li>
///	<li>The equality function should attempt to compare all data of both objects,
///	recursively if necessary, and may run in O(n) time.</li>
///	<li>The only object that may equal the Primitive instance is the Primitive instance.</li>
///	<li>The only object that may equal the Null instance is the Null instance.</li>
///	</ul>
///	
/// <hr />	
/// <h4>Security operations:</h4>	
///	
/// <code>setSecurityKey</code>:	<p>Change the security key of this object to be the provided object instance.  Security
///	keys allow an object to be locked down to prevent alteration by unauthorized parties.
///	Any object may be used as a security key.  By default, all objects start with Null as
///	their security key.  This requires you to pass the object's current security key in order
///	to be authorized to set a new one.  Not all object types participate in security; but
///	notably, UserObject and Fa√ßade do, and they alone are sufficient to be able to apply
///	security to all other objects.</p>
///	
/// <code>setSecurity</code>:	<p>Change the current security flags applied to this object, from the SMILE_SECURITY_*
///	enum.  This replaces the current security flags, in full.  You may only alter this object's
///	security if you provide the correct security key for it.  An object may choose to ignore
///	or alter requests to change its security, according to its own internal rules (for example,
///	an always-immutable object type, like String, may always prohibit attempts to
///	force it to allow WRITE access to its data).</p>
///	
/// <hr />	
/// <h4>Property operations:</h4>	
///	
/// <code>getProperty</code>:	<p>Retrieve a property of this object, by its symbol.  If no such property exists, this
///	must return the Null object.  (Note that this necessarily implies that there is no difference
///	as far as getProperty() is concerned between a nonexistent property and a property
///	containing Null.).  If this object prohibits READ security access, this should return
///	the Null object.</p>
///	
/// <code>setProperty</code>:	<p>Add or update a property of this object, by its symbol. If no such property exists,
///	this <em>may</em> create the property. Some objects may prohibit property additions
///	and modifications; some may only allow specific values for some properties; and some
///	may observe the security rules when adding or updating properties.  No guarantees are
///	placed on the behavior of this method.</p>
///	
/// <code>hasProperty</code>:	<p>Determine whether this object has the named property.  Should return true if
///	the object has this property, or false if it does not.  This method usually (but not always!)
///	matches whether getProperty() for this object would return a non-Null value.  If this
///	object prohibits READ access, thish should usually return false for all symbols.</p>
///	
/// <code>getPropertyNames</code>:	<p>Retrieve a list of symbols that identify all of the properties of this object.  This
///	data is informative, not normative.  In general, it <em>should</em> return a list
///	that contains all the symbols for which hasProperty() would return true.  If this object
///	prohibits READ access, this should usually return Null (the empty list).</p>
///		
/// <hr />	
/// <h4>Conversion operations:</h4>	
///	
/// <code>toBool</code>:	<p>Construct a Boolean representation of this object.  This conversion will be used
///	in many places, including if-statements, and should be based on the content of the
///	object:  For example, empty strings convert to false, but nonempty strings convert to
///	true.  Numeric values convert to false if they are zero, and true otherwise.  Most objects
///	other than numbers and strings should return true, but there can be legitimate reasons
///	for a nontrivial object to be false (a closed network stream, for example).</p>
///
/// <code>toString</code>:	<p>Construct a string representation of this object.  This conversion is used in many
///	places, and is intended to be <em>human-readable</em>, not necessarily a formal
///	serialization of the object.  It is used during debugging to observe the state of objects, and
///	is used by all of the <code>print</code> methods for outputting objects to streams.
///	Despite the fact that is it not intended to be a serialization method, many of the standard
///	built-in objects produce strings that are equivalent to a serialized form.</p>
///	
/// <hr />	
/// <h4>Special operations:</h4>	
///	
/// <code>call</code>:	<p>Invoke this object as a function.  The number of arguments will be provided directly, and
///	the arguments themselves will be on the temporary stack of the current closure.</p>
///
/// <code>getSourceLocation</code>:	<p>Get the location in the source code where this object was created, if known.</p>
///	
/// <code>unbox</code>:	<p>Copy this object into the provided argument container, unboxing it (if
///	appropriate).  This is the opposite of the 'box' operation, below.</p>
///	
/// <code>box</code>:	<p>Copy the given argument container's value onto the heap, boxing it (if necessary)
///	and returning the boxed value.  This is the opposite of the 'unbox' operation, above.</p>
///
