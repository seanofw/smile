Smile Code of Conduct
=====================

As I write this, the C implementation of the Smile interpreter has had 141 commits.  It doesn't even work yet, and has only two watchers and one star on GitHub.  So why create a community standards document when there *isn't* a community?

The answer is to lay the seeds for a good community at the beginning, when this project is still a tiny seedling, so that as the Smile programming language grows and blossoms, the community grows and blossoms with it into something that is beautiful and delightful and doesn't ever have the chance to grow into something cruel and dark. Smile's promise is, as its name implies, to make us all smile again while coding, but having a good language alone is not enough:  The community around it must be positive, open, helpful, and welcoming.

So these are the rules I promise to adhere to when interacting with you.  They are also the rules I expect you to adhere to when interacting with me.  And they are the rules I expect you to follow when interacting with others.

The Ten Commandments of the Smile Community
-------------------------------------------

1. **Be civil.**

    Don't be a jerk.  Say "please" when you want something, and "thank you" when someone helps you.  Don't swear without a good reason.  Don't insult or demean people — to their face, or behind their back.  You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar, you know?

2. **Respect differences of opinion.**

    You may be right.  You also may be wrong.  If someone disagrees with you, they have a right to do so, and you don't get to call them on it no matter how wrong you think they are.  Find common ground when and where you can, and then move on.

3. **Be willing to compromise.**

    There are few things worse in this world than extremism.  If you're on the farthest end of an argument, no matter which end you're on, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">odds are pretty good</a> that you're wrong in some way.  Be willing to compromise — and that means *you* giving up some part of your position for the greater good.

4. **All languages are good, and all languages suck.**

    Smile is a good language, but it is not necessarily the "best."  No language is.  Some languages are better at some tasks than others, and some are worse than some tasks than others.  Smile is a powerful tool, but it is not the best at all things, and never will be.  So no debating "best" languages, and no being smug or superior about *your* preferred language:  If someone prefers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)">Ruby</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C#</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl">Perl</a> over Smile, they're fully welcome to do so, and we will *not* demean them or devalue them for their choice.  We will, in fact, make an effort to laud the good things in every language, even if it is not our preferred language:  Even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">Fortran</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUMPS">MUMPS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic">Visual BASIC</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a> have good points to them.  We will help people, we will be kind to people, and we will openly welcome people who work in other languages, no matter their background.

5. **Discrimination is wrong.**

    It seems like it should go without saying that in this new millennium, all people have something to contribute regardless of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)">race</a>, skin color, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationality">nationality</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed">creed</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion">religion</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender">gender</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_identity">sexual identity</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation">sexual orientation</a>.  If you want to discriminate based on any of those things, the Smile community has no room for you.  Period.  We welcome all, whether you're a flag-waving straight white Christian conservative, or a gay liberal black athiest:  If you want to contribute, and you can tolerate us, you are always welcome.

6. **Don't be thin-skinned.**

    People take offense too easily these days.  The Smile community is not intended to be a "safe space."  There will be disagreements, and there will be arguments, and there will be jokes, and there will be laughing, and things may sometimes get a little raucous or a little rough, and people may say things they later regret. That's *okay*.  That's *all* okay.  It only becomes *not* okay when *you* take offense to things that weren't intended to cause harm.  I'll try not to say things that will offend you, but others might, and you need to be able to take that in stride.  And there will be no witch-hunts, exiles, or excoriations.  Tolerance doesn't just mean that everyone accepts and respects you:  It means that you accept and respect others too, even if they say things you don't like.

7. **Apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">Postel's Law</a>.**

    "Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send."  That law built half the Internet, and it works well in communities too.  Accept what is said around you with a grain of salt; and be careful what you say lest others take it the wrong way.  I'm terrible at saying things that get taken the wrong way, but I keep trying, and you should too.

8. **Admit when you're wrong, and apologize.**

    When you're wrong, own up to it.  When you write a bug, own it.  When your design fails, admit to it.  In the long run, honesty will always serve you best.  And be prepared to say "I'm sorry."  You will be  expected to do so when you're wrong.  You will also be expected to do so if someone is hurt.

9. **Respect is earned, not taken.**

    Do not demand respect from others.  Perform actions worthy of their respect, and they will give it to you. We will be wary of pseudo-experts, "fanboys," and "popped-collars":  Talk is cheap, but actions matter; if someone hasn't done something worthy of respect, don't give it to them just because of their name, their association, or their history.  But at the same time, we will acknowledge those whose actions demonstrate they are worthy of respect: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a> could attack Smile all day, but we would still respect him for his decades of phenomenal accomplishments.

10. **Kindness is its own reward.**

    We will strive not just to be civil to others, but to be kind, helpful, and understanding to them, no matter their background, preferences, skills, or experience.  We were all once beginners, and we were all once outsiders, and we will strive to help them as we would like others to help us.

There you go.  That's the ten commandments for the as-yet nonexistent Smile community.  When you write in the Smile wiki, or discuss Smile in your blog, or post a bug report, or contribute a new library, or interact in person with others in the Smile community, you will be expected to follow these rules.

And they're really not hard rules to follow:  Everything you really need to know about how to be a good citizen in the Smile community?  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Really-Need-Know-Learned-Kindergarten/dp/0449908577">You probably learned it</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindergarten">kindergarten</a>.

Special Topics
==============

Harassment
----------

It should go without saying that intentional harassment is absolutely unacceptable, but we live in a time where apparently that needs to be said.  The following community rules apply:

  - Do not speak or write or act in ways intended to be sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, ageist, or otherwise discriminatory.
  - Do not use suggestive, derogatory, or inappropriate nicknames or terms.
  - Do not insult, attack, or belittle others.
  - Do not troll, intimidate, or harass others, online or in person.
  - Do not act violently or threaten violence, online or in person.

Also, because I get to write the rules, the following are very explicitly spelled out as unacceptable behaviors and are not tolerable in any shape or fashion:

  - **The Bannon Rule**: Nativist and racist hate speech will not be tolerated.
  - **The Breitbart Rule**: Supporting, citing, or in any way attempting to normalize Breitbart, InfoWars, the Daily Stormer, or similar hate sites will not be tolerated.
  - **The Nazi Rule**: Supporting, citing, or in any way attempting to normalize the KKK, Nazi Party, or any racial supremacist group will not be tolerated.
  - **The LGBTQ Rule**: Attacks, insults, intimidation, or belittlement of anyone over their gender or sexual preferences will not be tolerated.
  - **The Weinstein Rule**: Intentionally sexually harassing anyone in the community --- including unwanted writing, speech, and physical contact --- is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.

Jokes
-----

*a.k.a., the PyCon Rule*

This a tough gray area:  What seems funny and harmless to one person may be insulting and hateful to another.

To that end, there is a special exemption to most of the rules for jokes, but they have to be *intended* to be funny, and there must not be a hidden *intent* to disparage.  It's one thing if you end up hurting someone and apologize; it's another entirely if hurting someone was your goal.

It's also important to understand *who* is saying the joke, whether it is spoken from a position of power, or by a historically disenfranchised group.  So, for example, men making jokes about women can be a mild form of harassment, while women making jokes about men probably isn't.

"Jokes" which are not really jokes and are intended to hurt, belittle, and disparage will be treated no differently than any other form of hate speech.  Jokes that are *not* intended to hurt, belittle, or disparage but end up being interpreted that way by some of their recipients do not violate the Code of Conduct.

Jokes, then, will be handled on a case-by-case basis, in context, with careful analysis of the speaker's *intent*.  When submitting an issue related to this, please provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate the speaker's *intent*.

In other words:

  - You can be funny, but please also try to be nice.
  - Remember that your jokes may be misinterpreted, so be careful what you say.
  - If you offend someone with a bad joke, apologize.
  - And if you hear a bad joke, don't jump to conclusions about its speaker, but gather evidence and make sure they were actually *trying* to attack you.
 
Public Shaming
--------------

In general, public shaming is the wrong way to solve a problem.  Do not publicly shame people who disagree with you, online or in person.  If you have an issue with someone, report the issue privately through the proper channels described in this Code of Conduct.  Disparagement is disparagement, no matter whether you feel morally-justified in speaking out.

The only exception to this rule is when the person both (A) is a public figure and (B) has been proven to have violated the Code of Conduct and censured/punished for it.  Even there, you should try to avoid public shaming, but it will not be considered a violation of this Code to do so.

Private Lives
-------------

*a.k.a., the Eich Rule*

What someone does *outside* the community doesn't affect you unless it's specifically *intended* to affect you.  These actions outside the community are part of the *private lives* of their originators, as they do not have the requisite *mens rea* --- the *intent* to disparage.  Someone has to intend to hurt *you* before they can *actually* hurt you.

The following are examples of things that occur in *private lives* that are *not* considered community violations.  This is not an exhaustive list, but merely some examples.

  - A professional stand-up comedian who makes racist jokes as part of his act, but donates to the community in his free time, and when he's off the stage, is polite and respectful to everyone he meets, regardless of race.
  - A conservative Christian who donates to the community in his free time, and who is respectful of everyone within the community no matter their gender, but who politically donates money to anti-LGBTQ movements.
  - An artist who paints erotic artwork, but who never discusses his employment while interacting with the community, and is otherwise respectful and professional with everyone he meets.

None of these meet the *mens rea* requirement --- the *intent* to directly disparage or harass or hurt someone else.  Just because we don't agree doesn't mean we can't work together.

If issues arise related to private lives, they will be decided on a case-by-case basis, in context.

Enforcement
===========

Speech and actions have consequences, and intentionally unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated.

In common law, there are two requirements for someone to be culpable of a crime:  First, the guilty act itself must be committed --- *actus reus* --- and second, the mental state involved --- *mens rea* --- must indicate an *intent* to cause a crime.  These two principles apply to this community policy as well.

Violations of this Code of Conduct will be considered on a case-by-case basis --- these rules are *not* a blanket zero-tolerance policy.  The accused also will be considered innocent until proven guilty, so if you need to report an issue, please back up your claim with evidence.

At some point in the future, I hope that enforcement of this policy will be taken over by a suitable jury; for now, I'm the sole judge.  So if you are the subject of, victim of, or witness to any violations of the above Code of Conduct, please contact me *personally* at `sean AT werkema D0T com`, and I will read your evidence and determine what an appropriate response is.

I want a community where everyone feels comfortable being involved, and I will take every message I receive on this topic very seriously.  I've been on the receiving end of unstopped harassment before, and have no intention of letting it happen when I can do something about it.  If violations occur, I can and will take any appropriate action within my power to stop them, up to and including expulsion.
