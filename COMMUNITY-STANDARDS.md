Smile Community Standards
=========================

As I write this, the C implementation of the Smile interpreter has had 141 commits.  It doesn't even work yet, and has only two watchers and one star on GitHub.  So why create a community standards document when there *isn't* a community?

The answer is to lay the seeds for a good community at the beginning, when this project is still a tiny seedling, so that as the Smile programming language grows and blossoms, the community grows and blossoms with it into something that is beautiful and delightful and doesn't ever have the chance to grow into something cruel and dark. Smile's promise is, as its name implies, to make us all smile again while coding, but having a good language alone is not enough:  The community around it must be positive, open, helpful, and welcoming.

So these are the rules I promise to adhere to when interacting with you.  They are also the rules I expect you to adhere to when interacting with me.  And they are the rules I expect you to follow when interacting with others.

The Ten Commandments of the Smile Community
-------------------------------------------

1. **Be civil.**

    Don't be a jerk.  Say "please" when you want something, and "thank you" when someone helps you.  Don't swear without a good reason.  Don't insult or demean people — to their face, or behind their back.  You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar, you know?

2. **Respect differences of opinion.**

    You may be right.  You also may be wrong.  If someone disagrees with you, they have a right to do so, and you don't get to call them on it no matter how wrong you think they are.  Find common ground when and where you can, and then move on.

3. **Be willing to compromise.**

    There are few things worse in this world than extremism.  If you're on the farthest end of an argument, no matter which end you're on, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">odds are pretty good</a> that you're wrong in some way.  Be willing to compromise — and that means *you* giving up some part of your position for the greater good.

4. **All languages are good, and all languages suck.**

    Smile is a good language, but it is not necessarily the "best."  No language is.  Some languages are better at some tasks than others, and some are worse than some tasks than others.  Smile is a powerful tool, but it is not the best at all things, and never will be.  So no debating "best" languages, and no being smug or superior about *your* preferred language:  If someone prefers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)">Ruby</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C#</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl">Perl</a> over Smile, they're fully welcome to do so, and we will *not* demean them or devalue them for their choice.  We will, in fact, make an effort to laud the good things in every language, even if it is not our preferred language:  Even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">Fortran</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUMPS">MUMPS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic">Visual BASIC</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a> have good points to them.  We will help people, we will be kind to people, and we will openly welcome people who work in other languages, no matter their background.

5. **Discrimination is wrong.**

    It seems like it should go without saying that in this new millennium, all people have something to contribute regardless of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)">race</a>, skin color, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationality">nationality</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed">creed</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion">religion</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender">gender</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_identity">sexual identity</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation">sexual orientation</a>.  If you want to discriminate based on any of those things, the Smile community has no room for you.  Period.  We welcome all, whether you're a flag-waving straight white Christian conservative, or a gay liberal black athiest:  If you want to contribute, and you can tolerate us, you are always welcome.

6. **Don't be thin-skinned.**

    People take offense too easily these days.  The Smile community is not intended to be a "safe space."  There will be disagreements, and there will be arguments, and there will be jokes, and there will be laughing, and things may sometimes get a little raucous or a little rough, and people may say things they later regret. That's *okay*.  That's *all* okay.  It only becomes *not* okay when *you* take offense to things that weren't intended to cause harm.  I'll try not to say things that will offend you, but others might, and you need to be able to take that in stride.  And there will be no witch-hunts, exiles, or excoriations.  Tolerance doesn't just mean that everyone accepts and respects you:  It means that you accept and respect others too, even if they say things you don't like.

7. **Apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">Postel's Law</a>.**

    "Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send."  That law built half the Internet, and it works well in communities too.  Accept what is said around you with a grain of salt; and be careful what you say lest others take it the wrong way.  I'm terrible at saying things that get taken the wrong way, but I keep trying, and you should too.

8. **Admit when you're wrong, and apologize.**

    When you're wrong, own up to it.  When you write a bug, own it.  When your design fails, admit to it.  In the long run, honesty will always serve you best.  And be prepared to say "I'm sorry."  You will be  expected to do so when you're wrong.  You will also be expected to do so if someone is hurt.

9. **Respect is earned, not taken.**

    Do not demand respect from others.  Perform actions worthy of their respect, and they will give it to you. We will be wary of pseudo-experts, "fanboys," and "popped-collars":  Talk is cheap, but actions matter; if someone hasn't done something worthy of respect, don't give it to them just because of their name, their association, or their history.  But at the same time, we will acknowledge those whose actions demonstrate they are worthy of respect: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a> could attack Smile all day, but we would still respect him for his decades of phenomenal accomplishments.

10. **Kindness is its own reward.**

    We will strive not just to be civil to others, but to be kind, helpful, and understanding to them, no matter their background, preferences, skills, or experience.  We were all once beginners, and we were all once outsiders, and we will strive to help them as we would like others to help us.

There you go.  That's the ten commandments for the as-yet nonexistent Smile community.  When you write in the Smile wiki, or discuss Smile in your blog, or post a bug report, or contribute a new library, or interact in person with others in the Smile community, you will be expected to follow these rules.

And they're really not hard rules to follow:  Everything you really need to know about how to be a good citizen in the Smile community?  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Really-Need-Know-Learned-Kindergarten/dp/0449908577">You probably learned it</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindergarten">kindergarten</a>.
